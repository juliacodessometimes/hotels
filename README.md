# hotels
This is a final project for an introductory course in Natural Language Processing. My idea here was to compare the language used in Yelp and TripAdvisor reviews to uncover any potential differences between how users on each website wrote about their experiences after staying in the same hotel.

My analysis aimed to address any preconceptions we might have about the "type" of person who might leave a review on either website: Do Yelp users use harsher language than TripAdvisor users when describing bad experiences? Are TripAdvisor users less concerned with how clean the rooms are is as compared to Yelp users?

While the conclusions to my analysis don't provide many clear answers to the questions above, it was interesting to see "hot topics" shared among all users for both good and bad hotel reviews. Perhaps the greatest takeaway provided by this project (and a free bit of advice to all aspiring hoteliers) is that if your hotel website mentions a pool, your hotel better have a working pool.
